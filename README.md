# Tic Tac Toe

This is the game of Tic Tac Toe coded with Angular 5 ([Demo](https://mosherc.github.io/tic-tac-toe)). It's essentially an object with a 3x3 2D array data structure with all the rules implemented as turn methods. The game will track the moves in the move log on the left, and it checks for a winner after each turn after the first five. It uses the move log to undo moves if you happened to make a mistake and press the undo button. 

## How to run locally

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server after cloning and running `npm install`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
